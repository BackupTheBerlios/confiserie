what is confiserie ? 
-------------------
it's a replacement for GNU(Posix?) systems of the well known gnu autoconf 
it's also the french term for "sweet". it's like them : a small goodlooking
tastefull thing that make developers happy ^_^

it's a set of scripts to run to check particular requirements of a package, a script to help user maintaining the pakage's scripts, a set of Makefiles templates 

the main goal is to teach user good behaviour when creating a software and not only depend on autotools whithout understanding a single step of what they do

why such a Project? 
--------------------
because autoconf rely on the knowledge of 2 languages to be used and extented : 
->(ba)sh for checking the return values in case of use and in case of 
extention you need to know sh to create the test
->m4 to include it inside your sh test for use and m4 to include it into 
autoconf for extension

because autoconf need the creation and create lot of unused files

because the same can be achieved more easely with well designed sh scripts 

because programmer often learn sh to make simple SA tasks and find autoconf 
script unreadable

because the output of an autoconf/automake is often unreadable and don't take 
advantages of modern make

HOW will it work? How can I use it?
--------------------
see html documents in doc folder.

special thanks :
-------------------
to the autotools maintainers that helped to develop opensources
to the autoconfs because some of the scripts provided are port of their work
