what's this?
------------------
this is a set of makefiles that I created during my own projects
I feel that those could be used to help user beggining a project

why?
------------------
usually a user starting a project often don't know about makefile
often they are told that Makefile are hard to create/maintain
so they try first tools like automake (which imply the use of autoconf)
without even regarding "info make". if they have done it they will see
that automake don't really is simplier.... and often when the project
grows the developper want to do something fancy, and have to learn about
Makefiles.....

how is it simplier?
-------------------
it's not ^_^ but consider this 2 cases :
1) learn automake, then later learn make
2) learn make
I propose the 2)

so it's more complex?
--------------------
it's not ^_^
I created "themed Makefiles" each containing a set of rules to perform
some usual tasks
the Makefiles have been designed to be compatible each other and will try
to only use CFLAGS, LDFLAGS like variables
you can merge the themes to create a bigger project or use include command of
make to include defaults rules

how are they compatible?
-------------------
some environnement variables are used and should be set in topsource makefile
(see the template included)
TOPSRC_DIR will contain a absolute path of the top source directory, this allow
you to create abitrarly nested sources
confiserie will create a Makefile that will define the needed variables (such
as CCMSG....)

note that thoses makefiles depends on the $confiserie/beautifull_make_rules.sh
into ./configure
