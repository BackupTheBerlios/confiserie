<h1>How <strong>Not</strong> to Use VPATH</h1>

<p></p><hr>
<blockquote>
One of the most common things people try to do with GNU
<code>make</code> is use the VPATH feature for multi-architecture
builds.

<p> This is certainly possible, but it isn't nearly as straightforward
as you might first imagine.  This isn't necessarily due to deficiencies
in VPATH, per se, as much as a lack of understanding of what VPATH is
for and how it works.

</p><p> In particular, you must take note of <a href="http://make.paulandlesley.org/rules.html#rule3">Paul's Third Rule of Makefiles</a>!  This is the
key.  VPATH was designed to find <em>sources</em>, not <em>targets</em>.
</p></blockquote>

<p></p><hr>

<p> To try to prove this to you, we'll walk along beside someone
attempting to create a makefile using VPATH to place targets into
another directory from the source files.

</p><p> To set this up yourself, construct an environment like this:

</p><pre>  $ mkdir /tmp/mktest

  $ cd /tmp/mktest

  $ mkdir obj src

  $ cd src

  $ cat &gt; foo.c
  int main() { extern int bar(); return bar(); }
  ^D

  $ cat &gt; bar.c
  int bar() { return 0; }
  ^D
</pre>

<p></p><hr>

<h2>Step One</h2>

<p> The first attempt at using VPATH usually goes something like this:

</p><pre>  OBJDIR = ../obj

  VPATH = $(OBJDIR)

  %.o : %.c
          $(COMPILE.c) $&lt; -o $(OBJDIR)/$@

  all: foo

  foo: foo.o bar.o
          $(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $(OBJDIR)/$@
</pre>

<p> There are many things wrong with this makefile.  First, note that
both the pattern rule to build <code>.o</code>'s and the explicit rule
to build target <code>foo</code> violate <a href="http://make.paulandlesley.org/rules.html#rule2">Paul's Second Rule of Makefiles</a>.

</p><p> Although they say ``the commands I list here will create a
<code>X</code> from a file <code>Y</code>'', that is <em>not</em> what
the commands actually do.  Instead, they create <code>../obj/X</code>
from <code>Y</code>.  This is not the same thing at all, and GNU
<code>make</code> will become very upset with the deception.

</p><p> So, what will happen?  Well, GNU <code>make</code> will build the
<code>.o</code>'s correctly, but when it tries to build link the
executable it will <em>think</em> that they are <code>foo.o</code> and
<code>bar.o</code>, not <code>../obj/foo.o</code> and
<code>../obj/bar.o</code>, and so it will invoke the linker like this:

</p><pre>  $ gmake
  cc -c foo.c -o ../obj/foo.o
  cc -c bar.c -o ../obj/bar.o
  cc foo.o bar.o -o ../obj/foo
  ld: foo.o: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p> The link will, of course, fail, since the <code>.o</code> files
don't exist in the current directory, but rather in
<code>$(OBJDIR)/</code>.

</p><p></p><hr>

<h2> Step Two </h2>

<p> Seeing the above error, people try to build again.  The second time,
it will work:

</p><p></p><pre>  $ gmake
  cc ../obj/foo.o ../obj/bar.o -o ../obj/foo
</pre>

<p> Why did it work this time?  Well, this time, for the first time,
VPATH actually came into play.  When <code>make</code> wanted to build
<code>foo</code>, it looked for its dependencies first.  Using VPATH, it
was able to locate both <code>../obj/foo.o</code> and
<code>../obj/bar.o</code>, and it linked them together.

</p><p> Well, it's certainly annoying that the link fails the first time.
But, this isn't the worst of the problems with this setup.  Suppose you
modify <code>foo.c</code> and want to now rebuild.  What will happen
next depends on which version of GNU <code>make</code> you're using;
with <code>make</code> 3.75 and below you'll get a different result,
also incorrect (it will say ``Nothing to be done for `all''').  Here
we'll describe the newer GNU <code>make</code>:

</p><p></p><pre>  $ touch foo.c

  $ gmake -f step1.mk
  cc -c foo.c -o ../obj/foo.o
  cc foo.o obj/bar.o -o obj/foo
  ld: foo.o: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p> Argh!  It broke again.  Same reason as before.  Once again,
re-running the make gets the link to work.

</p><p></p><hr>
<h2>Step Three</h2>

<p> Well, that's obviously not acceptable.  Once this problem is
understood, people usually try to fix their makefiles by adding
<code>$(OBJDIR)/</code> at strategic points, perhaps like this:

</p><p></p><pre>  OBJDIR = ../obj

  VPATH = $(OBJDIR)

  $(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
          $(COMPILE.c) $&lt; -o $@

  all: foo

  foo: foo.o bar.o
          $(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $(OBJDIR)/$@
</pre>

<p> The creation of <code>foo</code> is still incorrect according to the
Second Rule of Makefiles, but since nothing depends on <code>foo</code>
in our example, this incorrectness will probably go unnoticed--at least
until you attempt to create an <code>install</code> rule, perhaps.

</p><p> Here the makefile wants to rely on VPATH to locate the
<code>.o</code> files, rather than prefixing them all with
<code>$(OBJDIR)/</code>.  A reasonable thought, perhaps, but this is not
how VPATH works.

</p><p> This is what happens if we start with a clean slate:

</p><pre>  $ gmake
  cc -c foo.c -o foo.o
  cc -c bar.c -o bar.o
  cc foo.o bar.o -o ../obj/foo
</pre>

<p> What happened?!  Well, in some sense it worked since it compiled and
linked everything OK, but it put the <code>.o's</code> in the current
directory instead of in the <code>$(OBJDIR)/</code> directory!

</p><p> To understand this, first remember that <code>make</code> always
builds <em>from the bottom up</em>, not from the top down.  By that I
mean it finds the target it wants to build, then looks at its
dependencies, and <em>it's</em> dependencies, etc.  So far it hasn't
tried to build anything.  Finally, when it gets to the bottom (no
dependencies, or dependencies that can't be rebuilt), it walks back up,
attempting to build every target.

</p><p> How does that explain things?  Well, to build <code>foo</code>,
<code>make</code> examines the first dependency, <code>foo.o</code>.
Then it tries to figure out how to build a <code>foo.o</code>.  You want
it to use your new rule, but it won't, because it's trying to build
<code>foo.o</code>, <strong>not</strong> <code>$(OBJDIR)/foo.o</code>.
So your rule doesn't match.  Instead it matches the builtin rule for
building <code>.o</code>'s from <code>.c</code>'s, and builds them in
the local directory.

</p><p></p><h2> Step Four </h2>

<p> Now people usually throw up their hands and just add
<code>$(OBJDIR)/</code> all over the place.  If they're tidy, they might
try to use some of GNU <code>make</code>'s functions to make things a
little simpler to read/modify:

</p><p></p><pre>  PROGS   = foo
  OBJECTS = foo.o bar.o

  # Shouldn't need to change anything below here...

  OBJDIR = ../obj

  VPATH = $(OBJDIR)

  $(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
          $(COMPILE.c) $&lt; -o $@

  OBJPROG = $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/, $(PROGS))

  all: $(OBJPROG)

  $(OBJPROG): $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/, $(OBJECTS))
          $(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $@
</pre>

<p> Well!  That should fix it!  And indeed it does.  This makefile will
work correctly in all situations.  However, there's something a little
strange about it.

</p><p> As written, it doesn't <strong>need VPATH</strong> at all!  It
explicitly adds the path to all the dependencies, so VPATH is never
consulted.

</p><p></p><hr>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p> So we've shown that the only reliable way to construct a makefile
that will place targets into a remote directory, rather than the current
directory, is by prefixing all the targets with that directory path.  In
other words, VPATH is useless to us for this purpose.

</p><p> How depressing.  Well, then, what the heck <strong>is</strong> VPATH
good for, anyway?  As described in <a href="http://make.paulandlesley.org/rules.html#rule3">Paul's
Third Rule of Makefiles</a>, VPATH is good for finding <em>sources</em>,
not for finding <em>targets</em>.

</p><p> That seems impractical.  After all, developers work on source files,
not target files, so requiring them to change to the target directory
before running <code>make</code> is a pain.

handling this common scenario.
